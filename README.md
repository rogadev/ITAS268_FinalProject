# ITAS268 CMS Final Project - Winter 2023

## Site Description

Welcome to the website for MossAway Services Inc., my small business that specializes in roof moss removal and exterior cleaning services. The purpose of this website is to attract potential customers and drive leads to my business. The site is designed with excellent SEO in mind, ensuring that potential customers can easily find me when searching for these services.

One of the key features of the site is the blog page, which serves as an FAQ for my business. By providing valuable information about my services, I hope to establish trust with potential customers and position myself as an expert in the field. The call-to-action, "request a quote", is the most important feature of the site. A successful conversion would be a submitted form for a quote request.

The website is built using Nuxt 3, a powerful framework for building server-side-rendered and static websites. I have also integrated it with Storyblok, a headless CMS that allows for easy content management and delivery. The result is a responsive, dynamic website with a clean and modern design that showcases my services and positions my business for success.

## Project Description

Welcome to my ITAS268 final project built with Nuxt 3 and Storyblok! The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in building a website using modern web technologies. In this project, I have chosen to use Nuxt 3, a powerful Vue.js-based framework for building server-side-rendered and static websites. I have also integrated it with Storyblok, a headless CMS that allows for easy content management and delivery.

With this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to create a responsive, dynamic website with a clean and modern design. The website features a home page, a blog section, and a contact page. The blog section is powered by Storyblok, allowing me to easily manage and publish blog posts. The website is also optimized for SEO and performance, with lazy loading and other optimization techniques.

I hope you enjoy exploring my project and seeing what I can do with Nuxt 3 and Storyblok!

## Local Development Setup Steps

I recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as your package manager for this Nuxt project.

### Project Dependencies

Start by installing the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn devo
```

If you already have a browser window open, you can run `yarn dev` instead to start the server without opening a new window.
